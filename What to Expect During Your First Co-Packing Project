Stepping into the world of co-packing for the first time? Whether you’re a startup brand ready to scale or an established business testing a new product line, partnering with a co-packer is a big move—and an exciting one! But like any major step, it helps to know what to expect. Here’s a practical breakdown of what your first co-packing project might look like, from your first conversation to your product hitting the shelves.

1. Discovery and Consultation
The process usually kicks off with a discovery meeting. You’ll share your vision, product specs, packaging preferences, timelines, and any certifications (like organic or gluten-free) that matter to your brand. Your co-packer will evaluate your needs and determine if they’re a good fit. Be ready to answer questions about your ingredients, sourcing, expected order volume, and shelf life.
Tip: Bring samples, test batches, or prototypes to show. The clearer your concept, the smoother the start.

2. Formulation and Sourcing Support
Some co-packers offer formulation help, especially if your product still needs refining. Others will expect a finished recipe or formula. You may also need to choose whether to supply your own ingredients and packaging (turnkey vs toll packing) or let them handle it all.
Expect: Lots of back-and-forth. It’s normal to adjust ingredients, packaging specs, or even your product label during this phase.

3. Trial Runs and Pilot Batches
Before full production, most co-packers will run a pilot batch or small-scale production test. This is your chance to catch problems before you go big—like leakage, texture changes, or labeling misprints.
Be prepared to test, taste, and possibly tweak. This stage is about quality control and making sure everything performs as expected on actual production lines.

4. Production Scheduling and Timelines
Once everything’s approved, the real manufacturing begins. Your co-packer will schedule your product into their production line, which may be shared with other clients. Lead times vary depending on season, batch size, and ingredient availability.
Pro tip: Always ask about current lead times—and buffer in a few extra days, just in case.

5. Packaging and Compliance
Your co-packer may help you source bottles, pouches, labels, cartons, or even shelf-ready displays. They’ll also verify that your packaging meets safety, shipping, and labeling regulations. If you’re selling across borders, regulatory compliance (FDA, USDA, CFIA, etc.) becomes even more important.

6. Logistics and Fulfillment
Once packed, where does your product go? Some co-packers offer warehousing and shipping services, while others expect your team to handle distribution. Make sure you clarify fulfillment expectations early.

7. Lessons Learned
No co-packing project is perfect. Expect minor hiccups—and lots of learning. Your first run is a major milestone. You’ll walk away with more confidence, clearer systems, and (hopefully) a product you’re proud to launch.

Final Thoughts
Co-packing is more than outsourcing—it’s a partnership. Clear communication, realistic timelines, and mutual trust go a long way. So breathe, ask questions, and stay curious. Your first co-packing project might just be the beginning of your brand’s big leap forward.
