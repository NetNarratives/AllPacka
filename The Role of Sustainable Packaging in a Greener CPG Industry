When you think about your favorite snacks, shampoos, or cleaning products, do you ever stop to think about what they’re wrapped in? Probably not. But packaging—especially in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry—plays a huge role in the fight for a greener planet.
What’s the big deal with packaging? Packaging is everywhere. From toothpaste tubes to bottled drinks, the CPG industry depends heavily on it to protect products, communicate brand identity, and deliver convenience. But here's the problem: traditional packaging is often made of plastic or other non-biodegradable materials that end up in landfills—or worse, in our oceans. According to the EPA, containers and packaging make up over 28% of U.S. municipal solid waste. That's a lot of trash!
This is where sustainable packaging steps in.
What is sustainable packaging? Sustainable packaging focuses on materials and design choices that reduce environmental impact. That means using recycled or recyclable content, minimizing excess packaging, and choosing materials that break down more easily over time. Think compostable wrappers, paper-based alternatives, and refillable containers.
Why does this matter to the CPG industry? The CPG industry is massive—and that means its packaging choices have enormous ripple effects. Brands that shift toward eco-friendly packaging can:
Reduce carbon footprints
Cut down on waste and pollution
Attract eco-conscious consumers
Stay ahead of environmental regulations
In short, going green is no longer just “nice to have”—it’s a business-smart move.
Who’s doing it right? Big brands are starting to make the switch. Unilever, for instance, has pledged to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025. Coca-Cola is testing paper bottles. Startups like Blueland and Loop are building entire business models around reusable or refillable packaging. These innovations show that it’s possible to be both sustainable and profitable.
Challenges on the road to greener packaging Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Sustainable packaging can be more expensive, harder to scale, and sometimes less durable than traditional materials. Not every city has the infrastructure to recycle or compost certain types of packaging. Brands need to think not just about the materials they use, but what happens after the customer throws them away.
The power of consumer choice Here’s the good news: consumers hold power, too. More people are choosing brands that align with their values. According to a 2022 McKinsey study, over 60% of consumers say they’d be willing to pay more for sustainable packaging. That demand pushes companies to innovate faster and smarter.
The bottom line Sustainable packaging isn't just a trend—it’s a necessary shift toward a greener CPG industry. As technology advances and consumer awareness grows, the possibilities for change become more exciting than ever. Whether you're a brand, a shopper, or just someone who wants to make a difference, remember this: every wrapper, bottle, or box you choose has an impact.
Let’s wrap things up the sustainable way.
