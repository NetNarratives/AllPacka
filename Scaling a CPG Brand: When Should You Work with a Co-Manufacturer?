As a CPG (consumer packaged goods) brand grows, the dream is simple: get your product into more hands, on more shelves, and into more carts. But with that growth comes a major question—should you keep manufacturing in-house or partner with a co-manufacturer?
Working with a co-manufacturer (also called a "co-man") can be a game-changer. But it’s not a one-size-fits-all decision. Let’s explore the signs that it may be time to scale with a co-manufacturer and what that shift could mean for your brand.
First: What Does a Co-Manufacturer Do?
A co-manufacturer helps produce your product on your behalf. You provide the recipe, formula, or specifications—they take care of the production, packaging, and sometimes even sourcing ingredients. This allows you to focus on other parts of your business like marketing, logistics, and distribution.
Signs It Might Be Time to Partner Up
You Can’t Keep Up with Demand
If you're running out of inventory faster than you can produce it, that's a red flag. Growth is great—but stockouts can kill your momentum. A co-man can help meet that rising demand quickly without you having to invest in new equipment or bigger facilities.
You’re Outgrowing Your Space
Small kitchens or rented facilities work great for launching, but once your orders grow into the thousands (or tens of thousands), your setup might start to crack under pressure. A co-manufacturer already has the capacity—and certifications—to produce at scale.
You Need Consistency Across Batches
When you're hand-pouring, hand-cutting, or managing small batches, consistency becomes a challenge. Co-mans use precise machinery and strict quality controls, ensuring that every bar, bag, or bottle looks and tastes the same.
You’re Expanding Into Retail or National Distribution
Retailers expect reliability. Late deliveries or inconsistent quality can hurt your chances of staying on shelves. A co-manufacturer can support large retail runs and ensure deadlines are met.
Labor and Compliance Are Eating Up Your Time
Running your own production means hiring staff, managing training, staying on top of food safety laws, certifications (like GMP or USDA), and more. A trusted co-man already has these systems in place.
What You Give Up (and What You Gain)
Yes, working with a co-man means giving up some control. You’re trusting someone else to make your product. But what you gain is focus. You can channel your energy into branding, sales, and innovation—while someone else handles the heavy lifting in production.
Of course, due diligence is key. Not all co-mans are created equal. Look for one that understands your category, has the capacity to grow with you, and sees you as a partner—not just a line on a schedule.
Final Thoughts
Scaling a CPG brand isn’t just about making more—it’s about making smart moves at the right time. If production is slowing you down, consider a co-manufacturer. It might just be the boost your brand needs to move from local favorite to national staple.
And remember: outsourcing production doesn’t mean you’re giving up your brand. It means you’re building it smarter.
