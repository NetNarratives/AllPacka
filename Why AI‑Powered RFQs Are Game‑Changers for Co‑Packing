Finding the right co-packer can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Brands often spend weeks (if not months) making phone calls, sending emails, and comparing capabilities—only to end up with a partner who isn’t quite the right fit. On the other side, co-packers juggle endless inquiries from brands that might not match their equipment, capacity, or minimum order quantities.
This is where CoPack Connect’s AI-powered RFQ (Request for Quote) system steps in—and it’s changing the game for both sides of the industry.
The Problem with Traditional Matchmaking
The traditional process of connecting brands and co-packers is slow, manual, and outdated. Brands must vet dozens of co-packers, often relying on vague online listings or referrals. Meanwhile, co-packers waste time responding to brands that don’t align with their operational needs.
This inefficiency costs time, money, and lost opportunities. A good co-packer-brand relationship is built on precision and alignment—but getting there has always been a challenge.
Enter AI-Powered RFQs
CoPack Connect has flipped the script by using artificial intelligence to automate and optimize the matchmaking process. When a brand submits an RFQ, the platform’s AI goes to work, analyzing hundreds of data points to instantly match them with the best-fit co-packers.
Think of it as a dating app—but instead of swiping left or right, the AI finds you a packaging partner based on real needs, capabilities, and goals.
